* M. Castillón gratefully acknowledges Dr. Jørgen S. Dokken for his invaluable technical assistance with the implementation of Lagrange multiplier methods in the FEniCSx computational framework. His guidance proved essential for the development of the energy-controlled solvers presented in this work and their subsequent integration into the `PhaseFieldX <https://github.com/CastillonMiguel/phasefieldx>`_ library (:footcite:t:`code_phasefieldx`).
