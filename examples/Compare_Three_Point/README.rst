Comparison: Three-Point Bending Test
====================================

This section presents two examples comparing the variational and non-variational solvers. To demonstrate their equivalence, as explained in the referenced paper, both examples use an identical setup, including the same mesh, materials, and boundary conditions. The only difference is the solver used in each case.
