LEFM: Theoretical Analysis and Benchmarks
=========================================

This section presents the theoretical analysis based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for different specimens, including:

- The center-cracked notched tension test.
- The three-point bending test.
- The ASTM standard test.

These examples are selected because the crack propagation path and geometric factors are well-established, allowing for analytical solutions. This makes it possible to derive theoretical results for evaluating and comparing the proposed framework. Additionally, numerical solutions are obtained by imposing the crack in the mesh and performing simulations for various crack lengths.

The LEFM results presented here form the foundation for validating the phase-field approach. By comparing the analytical solutions derived from LEFM with numerical results, this section demonstrates the consistency and accuracy of the proposed methodology. These examples provide a benchmark for understanding the behavior of fracture mechanics under well-defined conditions.
