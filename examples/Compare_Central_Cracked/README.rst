Comparison: Central cracked
===========================

Several aspects must be considered when working with phase-field models, such as the length scale parameter, mesh size, and energy split method. Additionally, it is important to account for the crack area and how it is treated in the simulation. In this section, we analyze the influence of these parameters on the results.
